# Polyglot CLI Tool: A Go and Rust Showcase

This project is a demonstration of building a simple, visually appealing Command-Line Interface (CLI) application in both Go and Rust. Both applications provide the same "Hello, World!" style output with a stylized ASCII header and colored text.

The primary goal is to compare the development experience and explore the CLI ecosystems of these two powerful languages.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

This repository is organized into two separate folders, one for each implementation:

* `/go-cli`: Contains the Go version of the CLI application.
* `/rust-cli`: Contains the Rust version of the CLI application.

Please see the `README.md` file within each respective directory for language-specific instructions, if any.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed to run these applications:

* **For the Go version:** [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.18 or newer)
* **For the Rust version:** [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
* A terminal that supports ANSI colors.

### Running the Applications

#### Go Version

1.  Navigate to the Go directory:
    ```bash
    cd go-cli
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    go get
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

#### Rust Version

1.  Navigate to the Rust directory:
    ```bash
    cd rust-cli
    ```
2.  Build and run the application (Cargo handles dependencies automatically):
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals

The next phase of this project is to expand these simple applications to perform more complex tasks, including:

- [ ] Adding subcommands using a CLI framework (`Cobra` for Go, `Clap` for Rust).
- [ ] Making interactive API calls to a backend Go service.
- [ ] Parsing and displaying real-world data from the API.
